We propose a system for determining the location of various IoT devices and being able to remotely access them.
Essentially our project has 3 main parts:

1. To create an indoor positioning system using the Return Time of Flight localization technique in order to create a 3D map of relevant devices via an anchored, central hub.
2. To create a ‘remote’ who’s position and orientation is tracked by sensors in (1) that the central hub will use to generate a vector extending forward in simulated space to whatever IoT device is being pointed at, and send a signal to turn on (and later more complexly interface with) that IoT device.
3. To create a phone app and phone case that will serve as both the ‘wand’ and a very intuitive and fast interfacing device for smart homes or industry applications.

Currently in smart homes, users must fumble through an ever increasing number of menus in order to interface with more and more devices. By taking the user’s orientation into account, we can quickly determine exactly which device a local user is attempting to interact with, and immediately generate the appropriate interface, making interfacing with these devices a much more smooth process.”


\subsection{Stage 0}
Early Deadline: End of this next week \\
Expected Deadline: End of the quarter \\
Late Deadline: First weekend of summer break \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop an algorithm to determine the position of IoT devices given distance from various reference nodes. This should include robust error handling
\item Determine the physical mechanism that ascertains the device's distance from these reference nodes (i.e. communication protocol and hardware used)
\item Determine the method by which the user can access the IoT devices, specifically how the user locates the device IoT device
\item Determine the specification of the central hub hardware that contains the reference nodes if one needs to exist
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Stage 1}
Early Deadline: Week 0 of Fall 2018 quarter \\
Expected Deadline: Before fall design review \\
Late Deadline: End of winter break \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Write the program that determines IoT device position using algorithm determined in Stage 0. The input to the program at this stage is simply generated test data
\item Using the hardware and protocol determined in Stage 0, write program (and configure hardware) to acquire the device's distance from a reference node. Data should be verified against hand measurements.
\item Design and assemble the central hub hardware if one needs to exist
\item Design a test UI to interact with a basic IoT device
\end{itemize}

% Testing with basic IoT device
\subsection{Stage 2}
Early Deadline: Before fall design review \\
Expected Deadline: End of winter break \\
Late Deadline: Before winter design review \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine a trivially simple IoT device to use for the test
\item Integrate the components developed in Stage 1 into one system
\item Test using the UI to turn on/off the IoT device selected. If central hub is used, the test should pass even in the presence of obstacles between the device and the hub.
\end{itemize}

% Developing a more scalable system
\subsection{Stage 3}
Early Deadline: End of fall quarter \\
Expected Deadline: End of winter break \\
Late Deadline: Before winter design review \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Determine the interface a hardware vendor must provide to the system to utilize the device's functionality
\item Determine how a UI is to be generated from information on IoT device
\item Ensure that the existing protocol supports an arbitrary number of IoT devices. Tweak algorithms if necessary
\end{itemize}

% Designing the more scalable system
\subsection{Stage 4}
Early Deadline: End of winter break \\
Expected Deadline: Before winter design review \\
Late Deadline: N/A \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Write the UI generator. The input is simply descriptions of fictitious IoT devices.
\item Develop the current system so that IoT device information and capabilities are sent to the user
\item Test the current on-off system on multiple trivially simple devices
\end{itemize}

% Testing the more scalable system
\subsection{Stage 5}
Early Deadline: Before winter design review \\
Expected Deadline: N/A \\
Late Deadline: N/A \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Develop a few simple IoT setups with limited functionality. Write the hardware specification for these. (i.e. three LEDs and a choice to turn on one of them)
\item Integrate the system with the UI generator.
\item Test the setup
\end{itemize}
