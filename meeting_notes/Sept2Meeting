- Worst case for database: turn down pinging frequency (good for database and HW)

Jesse
- Evaluate different database systems: SQL, MongoDB, other NoSQL databases, etc.
- Try to get basic querying from and writing to a database
Tanner
- Getting server up
- Try out a cross-platform app dev platform and get something really basic to run
	- Apache Cordova
	- Xamarin
	- etc.
- Requirements for app dev:
	- Should support version control without tons of bloated files and directories
	- Ideally, be open source (BSD license I think is best because then we can sell it)
	- Support C/C++ (easy to integrate with MCU and other APIs)
	- Roman wants it to run on Linux
	- Bare minimum: IOS, Android, and probably Windows (most common for business desktops)
	- In an ideal world: Mac OS X and Linux (Ubuntu specifically since that's most popular) as well
Roman and Chandler:
	- Mockup designs for the app (meeting Thursday at 8pm)
Roman and Jason:
	- Discussing hardware interfacing with DW1000
	- How do we know where the user is relative to the different items in the store?
Roman:
	- Look into PCB design houses and their pricing on custom boards

Features:
- Store-dependent shopping list. Add item by item. Search through the store's directory.
- No path through the store. Arrow that displays your direction.
- Manually check it off. You find the item at the spot.
- Database for the different stores, we also store all of the items in the store. Google Maps tells you where the store is/how far.
