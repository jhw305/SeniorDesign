Jesse
- meeting later this week to discuss database implementation details
- Store's Database
	- what module it is, how much it costs, item number, and potentially quantity
	- Query the store's database for item list.
- Central Database
	- every store that uses our software,
- SQL database is to be used
- Job for this week
	- API for database querying/writing to database for store 
	- We'll deal with central database next week. Later, we'll need to consider how
	to talk to the store's database over the Internet.
	- The software API does three things...
		1) it lets the app get information about the store's items and modules
		2) it provides an easy way to integrate with store inventory system.
		3) it abstracts the database system, so we can always change to MongoDB at
		a later point and all dependent code is fine
	- Look into Apache Cordova. The API may be written in JavaScript.

Tanner and Chandler
	- Begin developing the app GUI with dummy functions for the different features and such
	- The app needs to be cross-platform. At some point, we'll need to consider the store's
	perspective.
	- Experiment with Apache Cordova for now before we meet to hash out more technical details
	- Tanner should contact me since I forgot if he wanted to do DB or GUI stuff.

Jason
	- Look into how to determine a user's position relative to the store's items with existing
	mobile technology (GPS, Bluetooth, etc.).

Roman
	- Develop project schedule and meet with the other members
