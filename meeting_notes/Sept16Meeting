How do we know where the users are?
QR code on the public node.
You scan it.
The database up in the sky queries the store for the position of the public node.
You query the database up in the sky for the public node's position.
The public nodes are attached to carts and baskets.
Part of marketing: consumers must use carts or baskets to use this feature and
will therefore be tempted to buy more things
