Architecture Spec
-----------------
Passed to the simulation environment. Contains variable values that define how the system works at a high-level

Associated Variables:
- bool: determines whether modules ping the central hub with their locations or whether the central hub pings modules to acquire locations
- int: frequency at which the modules/central hub are pinged in pings/sec
- int: anchor node separation (side length of a square with each corner being an anchor node)
- int: distance anchor modules are from the central hub
- device_object: the device we're using for the module (ex. DW1000 with microcontroller or something). We need this so we can make device-specific specifications. The sim env acquires the device from this object.
- file object for .so library: C code is likely used to program the microcontroller on the devices; so write only the C code and compile it to a shared library
	- C code will likely just contain two functions
		- initialize the DW1000
		- toggle receiving of data from DW1000
		- trilaterate
	- We won't concern ourselves with the technical details of the MCU for now. We'll mostly just focus on the receive data and trilaterate functions in that code.

Associated Methods:
gen_docs( ) - generate a .csv file or a .tex file with different parameter values tabulated for documentation purposes
gen_consts( ) - if we're using C, we need a file with defined constants. This can be very easily generated from the arch spec, even if we don't support generating all of the code from the architecture spec. (likely hidden from the user beneath compile_dev_code( ))
compile_dev_code( ) - compile the .so library for the device
Central hub code can likely be Python code, so there's no need to worry about compiling the central hub .so for now. Maybe something to talk about though.
Depending on who wins that argument: gen_central_hub_code( ) , gen_device_code( ) :)

Features to be Determined:
Simulation may need to take into account available bandwidth for transmission between different modules. We may need to time multiplex on channels. These settings be specified in the arch spec.
Specific error correction codes, network protocol and acking behaviors, modulation schemes, etc. need to be provided to the arch spec by the device.

Notes for Our Code
------------------
We should use documentation generator like Doxygen
Some test suite should be used before allowing code to be pushed to Github
