Testbench with benchmark C programs
CPU

- ALU
	- number of ALUs
		- so the user can specify their own FPU or ALU or something
		- just cascade two argument ALUs
		- one argument ALU?
	- operations
		- user might want to be able to specify their own opcodes. But for now, just have the tool generate opcodes based on something naive like the order of the operations listed.
	- number of arguments to ALU

- Program Counter

- Memory
	- Hardware that actually accesses main memory
	- Should have the ability to switch between harvard or princeton architecture (n-way memories)
		- at what point in the hierarchy would you be able to tell the difference between i-cache and d-cache?
		- if we really care, restrict n to 1 or 2. (requirement: n >= 1)
	- Caching?
	- Should have the ability to have on-chip memory (i and d memory)

- Caching optional
