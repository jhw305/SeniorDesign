User accounts for each of us

Use same image to set up more servers

For Chandler:
- Take out DeviceFSM once you're done with everything
- Keep working on the DW1000's FSM
- Figure out the best solution for the physical_data dictionary for now. Roman'll probably
refactor it next week.

Responsibilities for Roman:
- Get rid of update()
- Keep mainloop as abstract method
- When you implement mainloop, it's your responsibility to update actionqueue
- Figure out how the sim env gets device to change state

- Tell Jesse to use fn ptr
