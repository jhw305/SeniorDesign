Action Object
-------------
3 members
- Member 1: Function to be called
- Member 2: Array of function arguments
- Member 3: Counter that keeps track of how long we have until the next state

Simulated
---------
	Simulated (abstract class)
	/      \
     Device   Hub

Device
------
Each device has an action queue. Whenever it performs action, push to action queue. (Action object)
- Queue is an array of action objects. [ Action1 , Action2, ... ]
Every time the update function is called, decrement the counter of the first action in the action queue.
If the counter is 0, then call the function with the corresponding arguments. Pop the action object off the queue.
If the action queue is empty, then do nothing.
Sim env calls update function on device.

Anchor
- instance of the Device class
- Sim env has an array of anchors that are used to ping the device
- Also has an array of nodes
Sim env
- InitializeNetwork :: generate hub, nodes, and anchors based on arch spec parameters
- analyze :: runs the simulation and takes note of system lifetime and average error in position
- signal_list :: keeps track of all the signals sent from device/anchor to device/anchor
		       
Hub
- pingNode :: pass reference to device object as an argument ;
	      enqueue all of the pinging actions for the anchors
- generateMap :: calls pingNode for the different nodes in the network ;
		 acquires the position of each one based on the arch spec

Arch spec - needs to work with generated map
