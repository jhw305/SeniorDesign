System that makes it very easy for users to find the exact location of items in a store.
This includes a mobile application the user would use to find the items in the store. List all the items you want to buy and it tells you where they all are. - Benefit to shopper
Benefit to store - theft protection and can determine location of all items in the store
Table that maps ID of each module to the item.
Module - Board design and 3D printed package (antenna, transceiver, small battery to last a while, etc.). Electrically-actuated mechanical switch on housing. This way you can securely open or close it and attach it to clothing only if you have the proper credentials.
For proof of concept, use RPi with transceiver as central hub. You have four modules as your starting modules. These can be used to detect the location of all of the other modules in a 3 football field radius.
The app interfaces with the store's interface.
Store provide the layout so we have the map.
Tentatively: put module on the shopping cart/basket. This tracks the user in the app.

1) Meet once every two weeks over summer to plan out technical details
2) Fall we start hardware and software design. We want to present some proof of concept already at fall design review.
3) Winter quarter, full system done by winter design review. Lit demo

Ours are active and is therefore more user friendly. The active power used is negligible.
