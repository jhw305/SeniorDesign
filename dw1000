What are the operating states of the DW1000? How much current does a DW1000 state consume?
DW1000 is a half-duplex device. Can either be receiving or transmitting, but NOT both.
- IDLE
	- 18mA without DC/DC, 12mA with DC/DC
	- Most components are clock gated to save power. CLKPLL is locked and running.
	- Analog receive and transmit circuitry is not powered
	- Can be informed to enter TX or RX state. This transition can also be delayed per the user.
- INIT
	- 4mA
	- No SPI accesses allowed
	- Turns on CLKPLL
	- 5us before CLKPLL locking and then go to IDLE state
- SLEEP
	- 1uA
	- Make sure not to power GPIO and other pins to keep leakage current low
	- Can either wakeup using external WAKEUP signal or by use of a counter and a low power ring oscillator used in the chip
- DEEPSLEEP
	- 50nA
	- Only always-on (AON) memory is on
	- Remains in DEEPSLEEP until WAKEUP is signal is supplied
Note: When exiting SLEEP or DEEPSLEEP via wakeup signal, 500us delay.
7us delay when entering SLEEP or DEEPSLEEP because data is copied to AON memory
- OFF
	- 0
	- Powered off. No applied voltages.
- WAKEUP
	- Lasts about 4ms before entering the INIT state
	- Crystal oscillator turned on
- RX
	- Receive a frame
	- After frame is received or error/timeout occurs, return to IDLE state
	- If ARXSLP is enabled, enter SLEEP or DEEPSLEEP
	- Turnaround time RX to TX: 10us.
- RX PREAMBLE SNIFF
- TX
	- Transmit a frame
	- After we finish transmitting a frame, return to IDLE state
	- If ATXSLP bit is set, go into SLEEP or DEEPSLEEP mode assuming no host interrupts are pending.
	- Turnaround time TX to RX: 6us.
- SNOOZE
	- Like the INIT state
	- But a counter is running. When counter runs out, automatically enters RX state.
FSM for states - user manual (pg. 15)

Is there a programmable processor on chip? If so, how much on-chip memory is available, and is there an available API?
The processor needs to be off-chip. Received data is sent to the processor via an SPI interface.
Some on-chip memory is available: an 8KiB TX buffer and two 8KiB RX buffers.
Two RX buffers are used so that a packet can be received while one is being read from the other RX buffer.

Information on MAC unit (pg. 25) - timestamping, acking, etc.
BW, channel, and data rate info (pg. 17)
Output power and spectrum control to meet FCC standards (pg. 19)
Includes temperature and voltage monitors - maybe warn user that it's too hot or that you're running low on power or something
48 pins and one ground pin

Ideas for simulation

Two parts to sim env:
Environment
	Abstract class for a device - DW1000 inherits this device class.
		- FSM that describes transition times and current consumed. Maybe some randomness allowed as well.
		- Simulate clk speeds for SPI communications and such in each state. (state and FSM classes?)
		- SPICE models available for chip?
Architecture Spec

From arch spec, we can:
Generate documentation
Generate source
	- Should be somewhat machine independent. It is reasonable to believe that we could use a different chip.
