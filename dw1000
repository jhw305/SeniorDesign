What are the operating states of the DW1000? How much current does a DW1000 state consume?
DW1000 is a half-duplex device. Can either be receiving or transmitting, but NOT both.
- IDLE
	- 18mA without DC/DC, 12mA with DC/DC
	- Most components are clock gated to save power. CLKPLL is locked and running.
	- Analog receive and transmit circuitry is not powered
	- Can be informed to enter TX or RX state. This transition can also be delayed per the user.
- INIT
	- 4mA
	- No SPI accesses allowed
	- Turns on CLKPLL
	- 5us before CLKPLL locking and then go to IDLE state
- SLEEP
	- 1uA
	- Make sure not to power GPIO and other pins to keep leakage current low
	- Can either wakeup using external WAKEUP signal or by use of a counter and a low power ring oscillator used in the chip
- DEEPSLEEP
	- 50nA
	- Only always-on (AON) memory is on
	- Remains in DEEPSLEEP until WAKEUP is signal is supplied
Note: When exiting SLEEP or DEEPSLEEP via wakeup signal, 500us delay.
7us delay when entering SLEEP or DEEPSLEEP because data is copied to AON memory
- OFF
	- 0A
	- Powered off. No applied voltages.
- WAKEUP
	- Current: ?
	- Lasts about 4ms before entering the INIT state
	- Crystal oscillator turned on
- RX
	- Current: on a byte by byte basis it consumes 113ma and goes into a 12ma wait for the next byte? (p. 32)
	- Receive a frame
	- After frame is received or error/timeout occurs, return to IDLE state
	- If ARXSLP is enabled, enter SLEEP or DEEPSLEEP
	- Turnaround time RX to TX: 10us.
- RX PREAMBLE SNIFF
- TX
	- Current: ? (may depend on output TX power setting)
	- Transmit a frame
	- After we finish transmitting a frame, return to IDLE state
	- If ATXSLP bit is set, go into SLEEP or DEEPSLEEP mode assuming no host interrupts are pending.
	- Turnaround time TX to RX: 6us.
- SNOOZE
	- Current: ?
	- Like the INIT state
	- But a counter is running. When counter runs out, automatically enters RX state.
FSM for states - user manual (pg. 15)

Is there a programmable processor on chip? If so, how much on-chip memory is available, and is there an available API?
The processor needs to be off-chip. Received data is sent to the processor via an SPI interface.
Some on-chip memory is available: an 8KiB TX buffer and two 8KiB RX buffers.
Two RX buffers are used so that a packet can be received while one is being read from the other RX buffer.

p. 27 - General Calibration for the DW1000 Chips
In order to measure the ranges accurately, the antenna delay must be calibrated between two dw1000 devices
with a known distance. Calibration is recommended to be done for the transmission as well. 

p. 58 - OTP Memory Guide
Probably can be used for setting TX power levels and such

Information on MAC unit (pg. 25) - timestamping, acking, etc.
BW, channel, and data rate info (pg. 17)
Output power and spectrum control to meet FCC standards (pg. 19)
Includes temperature and voltage monitors - maybe warn user that it's too hot or that you're running low on power or something
48 pins and one ground pin

Need to buy test boards
Probably want to confirm timing and current levels in actual tests with the board
Ensure that the lifetime of whatever design can be tested in practice (maybe some setting on the board that drains all the battery power through rapid testing) - maybe current amplifier to reduce the lifetime by a factor of 10 - 100

Ideas for simulation

Two parts to sim env:
Environment
	Abstract class for a device - DW1000 inherits this device class.
		- FSM that describes transition times and current consumed. Maybe some randomness allowed as well.
		- Simulate clk speeds for SPI communications and such in each state. (state and FSM classes?)
		- SPICE models available for chip?
Architecture Spec

From arch spec, we can:
Generate documentation
Generate source
	- Should be somewhat machine independent. It is reasonable to believe that we could use a different chip.
